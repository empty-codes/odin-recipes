      <h2>Steps</h2>
      
      <h3>To make Ewa Agoyin</h3>

      <ol>
    	  <li>Pick out the specks of dirt from the beans, rinse and drain the beans a couple of times.</li>
    	  <li>Pour the beans in a stockpot, add the water and cook till it becomes very tender – about 2 to 2½ hours.</li>
    	  <li>Use a Potato Masher or a wooden spoon to mash the Beans to your preference.</li>
    	  <li>Set aside for now</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h3>To make the Ewa Agoyin stew</h3>
      <ol>
    	  <li> Rehydrate the dried Chilies and bell peppers by soaking them in water overnight or pour hot boiling water over them for about 2 hours</li>
    	  <li> Blend the rehydrated Peppers with the onions, ginger, and about a quarter cup of water and set aside.</li>
    	  <li> Preheat the Palm oil in a pan on medium heat until the oil is very hot but not bleached.</li>
    	  <li> Add the sliced onion and let it cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. We want it browned and not black or burnt.</li>
    	  <li> Stir in the blended peppers and cook for about 10 minutes</li>
    	  <li> Add the seasoning cubes, crayfish, and salt to taste.</li>
    	  <li> Leave it to cook for another 5 to 10 minutes; by this time, the color of the pepper would have changed from bright red to dark red. If not, cook for some additional time.</li>
      </ol>
